 In England the currency is made up of pound, &pound;, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation: 
 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, &pound;1 (100p) and &pound;2 (200p). 
 It is possible to make &pound;2 in the following way: 
 1 &pound;1 + 1 50p + 2 20p + 1 5p + 1 2p + 3 1p 
 How many different ways can &pound;2 be made using any number of coins?
