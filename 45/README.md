 Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae: 
 
 
 Triangle 
 &nbsp; 
 T  n  = n ( n +1)/2 
 &nbsp; 
 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... 
 
 
 Pentagonal 
 &nbsp; 
 P  n  = n (3 n  1)/2 
 &nbsp; 
 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... 
 
 
 Hexagonal 
 &nbsp; 
 H  n  = n (2 n  1) 
 &nbsp; 
 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... 
 
 
 It can be verified that T 285  = P 165  = H 143  = 40755. 
 Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
