Euler
=====

This repo is to collect my programs solving the problems in Project Euler Website. I'll probably include programs written for other questions and/or competitions and/or online coding portals. But so far, my focus is mainly on Euler.

Through this persistent exercise, I want a wholesome learning experience than to arrive hurriedly at a solution. As such, I've made it an on and off activity in my life to solve problems whenever I feel like. Although my strength is the C programming language, I've used a few other tools to arrive at the solution many times. I also hope to learn new languages, paradigms and tools that may help me with this programming potluck.

For the uninitiated, a small intro follows

About Project Euler
===================

What is Project Euler?
----------------------

* Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
* Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
* The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
